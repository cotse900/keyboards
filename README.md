# keyboard layouts
- I put keyboard layouts here for Windows. You need Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator (MSKLC) and .NET framework (how old...) to edit .klc files.

# UkrainianPhoneticA
- Derived from Russian mnemonic with dead keys for several letters. The back tick (`) dead key supports multiple characters but I swapped ы with ї.

# UkrainianPhoneticB
- Further edits of version A. No more dead keys except back tick. I put back all 33 letters on board plus a few good ASCII characters like @.
